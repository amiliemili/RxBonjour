# RxBonjour
Say "Hi!" to RxBonjour, a wrapper around Android's network service discovery functionalities with a support implementation for devices below Jelly Bean, going down all the way to API level 9.

Disclaimer: This library is to be considered **very early** in terms of maturity. There will probably be issues, especially since NSD is a fragile topic on Android!

## Download

`RxBonjour` is available on `jcenter()`:

```groovy
compile 'com.github.aurae:rxbonjour:0.3.3'
```

## Usage

Create a network service discovery request using `RxBonjour.startDiscovery(Context, String)` and subscribe to the returned `Observable` (this code is using Java 8 syntax for brevity):

```java
RxBonjour.startDiscovery(this, "_http._tcp")
		.subscribe(bonjourEvent -> {
			BonjourService item = bonjourEvent.getService();
			switch (bonjourEvent.getType()) {
				case ADDED:
					// Called when a service was discovered
					break;

				case REMOVED:
					// Called when a service is no longer visible
					break;
			}
		}, error -> {
			// Service discovery failed, for instance
		});
```

RxBonjour pre-configures the returned Observables to run on an I/O thread, but return their callbacks on the main thread. The discovery will be stopped automatically upon unsubscribing from the Observable.

## Implementations

RxBonjour comes with two implementations for network service discovery. By default, the support implementation is used because of the unreliable state of the `NsdManager` APIs and known bugs with that. If you **really** want to use `NsdManager` on devices running Jelly Bean and up though, you can specify this when creating service discovery Observables:

```java
// If you're feeling real and ready to reboot your device once NsdManager breaks, pass in "true" to use it for supported devices
RxBonjour.startDiscovery(this, "_http._tcp", true)
		.subscribe(bonjourEvent -> {
			// ...
		}, error -> {
			// ...
		});
```

### NsdManager implementation (v16)

On devices running Jelly Bean and up, Android's native Network Service Discovery API, centered around `NsdManager`, can be used.

### Support implementation (v9)

The support implementation utilizes the latest available version of [jmDNS][jmdns] (a snapshot of version **3.4.2**) and a `WifiManager` multicast lock as its service discovery backbone; because of this, including this library in your application's dependencies automatically adds the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`, in order to allow jmDNS to do its thing:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE"/>
```
